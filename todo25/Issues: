Issues: 
No /br
Font color is in the html
margin is 8px and margin-top is 8px, meaning that other margins aren't showing up
Problem--text is different sizes and keeps getting bigger
There isn't any text size
Nothing inhereted from H3 is showing up because it isn't designed as a stylesheet
Keeps inheriting from H3s
Nested H3s that keep inherriting
H3 tags are nested, and act relatively to each other?
H3 tags work relative to each other, so if they are nested, then they will change the size relative to the one above.
